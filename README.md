# Lab Task 2
 Triangle in C++

Description:
This C++ program presents an engaging ASCII art creation, forming a beautiful pyramid pattern composed of the number "0." The code leverages the standard C++ library and uses the "iostream" header to display this visually appealing design in the console. Each row adds one more "0" to create a pyramid effect, which, when executed, resembles an inverted pyramid. Additionally, the code sets the console text and background color to an aesthetically pleasing combination of cyan (C) and blue (B), enhancing the visual impact.

Instructions:

Compile and run this code within your C++ development environment.
Admire the mesmerizing pyramid pattern that emerges, with increasing "0"s in each row.
Experience the delightful color combination of cyan and blue, enhancing the overall visual effect.
Feel free to modify the code to adjust the pattern or experiment with different color schemes to create your own unique and visually captivating ASCII art using C++.
